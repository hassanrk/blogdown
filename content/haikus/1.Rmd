i

 

Sounds of needle leaves

bristle through my ears over

the sunbled streamlet

 

ii

 

Clinking of pennies

at an affluent building,

a bedridden pauper

 

iii

 

Swans in ballet shoes

under the spotlit bedlam

tip toe, tippy toe

 

iv

 

A single mother

And in her sinewy arms

rests a smiling child

 

v

 

Robins chirruping

under the blanket of clouds

near the verdant meadow

 

vi

 

City lights and roads

stand witness to waste flyers

and drunken high proles

 

vii

 

Near the dark alleys

I heard noises not acute

yet certainly trenchant

 

viii

 

The sound of water

trickle is just as clear as

the rushing river

 

ix

 

Four hundred twenty

is the sigil of despair

not of alcohol
